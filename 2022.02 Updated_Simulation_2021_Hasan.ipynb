        "We ran experiments on four data sets: (i) a simulated data set with 6 latent traits, 50 items, and 20,000 students; (ii) results from the Examination for the Certificate of Pro- ficiency in English (ECPE) (Templin and Hoffman, 2013), a real data set with 3 latent traits, 28 items, and 2922 students; (iii) a simulated data set with a 20 latent traits 200 items, and 50,000 students; and (iv) a simulated data set with 4 latent traits, 27 items, and 3,000 students. Note that comparisons with traditional techniques are only possible for (i), (ii), and (iv) because of the large number of latent traits in (iii). It is also worth pointing out that true parameter values, for both students and items, are only available for simulated data.\n",
        "When simulating data for (i) and (iii), we used Python’s SciPy package to generate a symmetric positive definite matrix with 1s on the diagonal (correlation matrix) and all matrix entries non-negative. All latent traits had correlation values between 0 and 1. We assumed that each latent trait was mean-centered at 0. Then, we sampled abil- ity vectors to create simulated students. We generated a random Q-matrix where each entry qij ∼ Bern(0.2). If a column qi∶ = 0 for each element after sampling from this Ber- noulli distribution, then one random element was changed to a 1. This ensures that each item measured at least one trait.\n",
        "Discrimination parameters were sampled from a range so that 0.25 ≤ MDISCi ≤ 1.75 for each item i, and difficulty parameters were sampled uniformly from [−3, 3]. Finally, response sets for each student were sampled from the ML2P model using these parameters. For data set (iv) we were more particular in selecting the Q-matrix and correlation matrix. Rather than generating these randomly, each entry in these matrices was chosen manually. Of the 4 skills in the correlation matrix, one of them is entirely independent of the other three. The other three latent abilities had correlations of 0.25, 0.1, and 0.15 between them. The correlation matrix was chosen in this way so that it is closer to the identity matrix, allowing the ML2P-VAEind variation to perform better. The Q-matrix was chosen so that it contained 16 “simple” items (items requiring only one skill), 6 13 items requiring 2 latent abilities, 4 items requiring 3 latent abilities, and one item requir- ing all 4 skills. In this way, each of the possible ( 4k ) combinations is present in the Q-matrix, for k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n",

Note that comparisons with traditional techniques are only possible for (i), (ii), and (iv) because of the large number of latent traits in (iii). It is also worth pointing out that true parameter values, for both students and items, are only available for simulated data.\n",
        "- When simulating data for (i) and (iii), we used Python’s SciPy package to generate a symmetric positive definite matrix with 1s on the diagonal (correlation matrix) and all matrix entries non-negative. All latent traits had correlation values between 0 and 1. We assumed that each latent trait was mean-centered at 0. Then, we sampled abil- ity vectors to create simulated students. We generated a random Q-matrix where each entry qij ∼ Bern(0.2). If a column qi∶ = 0 for each element after sampling from this Ber- noulli distribution, then one random element was changed to a 1. This ensures that each item measured at least one trait. \n",

        "For data set (iv) we were more particular in selecting the Q-matrix and correlation matrix. Rather than generating these randomly, each entry in these matrices was chosen manually. Of the 4 skills in the correlation matrix, one of them is entirely independent of the other three. The other three latent abilities had correlations of 0.25, 0.1, and 0.15 between them. The correlation matrix was chosen in this way so that it is closer to the identity matrix, allowing the ML2P-VAEind variation to perform better. The Q-matrix was chosen so that it contained 16 “simple” items (items requiring only one skill), 6\n",
